# Practical 3: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users

## Objective

Enhance AWS account security by enabling **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for an IAM user. MFA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second verification method beyond username and password.

---

## What is MFA?

**MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** requires users to present:
1. **Something they know** – Password
2. **Something they have** – A time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by a device/app

---

## Prerequisites

- An IAM user already created (e.g., `testuser`)
- Access to AWS Console with IAM permissions
- A smartphone with an authenticator app installed, such as:
  - Google Authenticator
  - Microsoft Authenticator (I used this)
  - Authy

---

## Steps to Enable MFA for an IAM User

### Step 1: Log in as Admin
- Go to **AWS Console**
- Open **IAM** service

---

### Step 2: Select the IAM User
1. Go to **Users**
2. Click on your user (e.g., `testuser`)
3. In the **Security credentials** tab, find **Assigned MFA device**

4. Click **Manage**

---

### Step 3: Choose MFA Device Type
- Choose: `Authenticator App` (recommended)
- Click **Next**

---

### Step 4: Set Up MFA App
1. Open your Authenticator app
2. Scan the **QR code** shown on the AWS Console

3. The app will start generating 6-digit TOTP codes

---

### Step 5: Enter MFA Codes
1. Enter two consecutive MFA codes generated by the app
2. Click **Assign MFA**

MFA is now enabled for the IAM user!

---

## Verification

1. Log out from AWS Console
2. Try logging in as `testuser`

3. After entering password, you’ll be prompted for the **MFA code**
4. Open your authenticator app and input the current 6-digit code

Successful login only happens if both factors are verified.

## Key Benefits of MFA

| Benefit                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Extra Layer of Security  | Prevents unauthorized access even if password is stolen |
| Easy to Implement        | Setup takes just a few minutes |
| AWS Recommended Practice | Helps meet compliance and security standards |

---

## Cleanup (Optional)

If doing this for testing only:
- ❌ Remove MFA device via **Manage MFA**
- ❌ Or delete the IAM user after practical


# Recap: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM Users

## What We Did

- Accessed the **IAM dashboard**
- Selected an IAM user (`testuser`)
- Enabled **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** using a virtual authenticator app (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator)
- Scanned the QR code from AWS
- Verified MFA setup using two consecutive TOTP codes
- Logged in as the IAM user to test MFA prompt

---

## What We Learned

###What is MFA?

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring:
- **Something you know**: your password
- **Something you have**: a one-time code from an authenticator app

---

### Key Terms

| Term            | Meaning |
|------------------|--------|
| **MFA**            | Multi-Factor Authentication – requires a second factor beyond password |
| **TOTP**           | Time-based One-Time Password generated by apps like Google Authenticator |
| **Virtual MFA**    | A software-based MFA device (mobile apps) |
| **Security Best Practice** | AWS recommends enabling MFA for all root and IAM users |

---

## Why It Matters

| Benefit                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Increased Security      | Stops attackers even if credentials are stolen |
| Prevents Unauthorized Access | Blocks access unless both password and TOTP are verified |
| Easy to Set Up         | Configured in minutes using common mobile apps |
