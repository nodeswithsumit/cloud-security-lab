# cloud-security-lab

Welcome to the **Cloud Security IoT Practicals** repository! This repo is designed for scloud securoty labs in 2 days for students exploring the fundamentals of **cloud security using AWS services**, tailored toward Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

## What You'll Learn

Participants will gain practical skills in:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup and security
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Monitoring and compliance
- Web application and data security
- Secrets management and container security

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into two days with 10 structured labs:

### Day 1 â€“ Network & Identity Security

1. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with security groups  
2. Manage user identities using IAM  
3. Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
4. Monitor activity with AWS CloudTrail  
5. Enforce compliance using AWS Config  

### Day 2 â€“ Threat Detection & Data Security

6. Protect applications using AWS WAF  
7. Encrypt data using AWS KMS  
8. Detect threats with AWS GuardDuty  
9. Secure container workloads with ECS  
10. Manage secrets using AWS Secrets Manager
